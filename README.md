# minesweeper

This is a work in progress, but in its current state, the solver seems to be somewhere around 46%. At the moment, it takes a long time to pick a cell when there are no more logical deductions. There are many improvements to be made, most importantly an update function that would drastically reduce the speed (although it would not affect the percentage). All of the TODO's require more work to resolve. Also there is an heuristic function which can always be made better by testing and tweaking.
